## Ken's "Inner Circle" Insight

From the conversation, Ken identified that deals often flow through board members and investors who influence decisions:

> "You have this kind of set of people that have had wonderful, successful careers and they're turning around and kind of giving back to the community... You end up being either a meaningful investor in a company or you're sitting on the board and you basically get involved in the decision making process."

**Implication for ICP:** The ideal customer may not be found through direct outreach alone. The pathway often goes:

```
Inner Circle Member → Board/Investor Role → Recommends Advisor → MPA Engagement
```

**Target the influencers:**
- Serial entrepreneurs who've exited
- Angel investors with portfolio companies
- Board members serving multiple companies
- Lawyers/accountants who advise business owners
- PE fund operators with regional focus
