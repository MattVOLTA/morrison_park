# Succession Signals Reference

## Overview
These signals indicate a business owner may be approaching a succession decision (sale, transition, or exit). The more signals present, the higher the likelihood of near-term transaction activity.

| Apparent Signal | Why It's Misleading |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Owner is "old" | Many owners work into their 80s |
| No website updates | May just be marketing neglect |
| Declining revenue | Could be industry cycle, not exit signal |
| Owner talks about "legacy" | Common at any age |

## Combining Signals

**High succession likelihood (3+ signals):**
- Owner 60+
- No successor identified
- Industry consolidation occurring
- Recent operational cleanup

**Medium succession likelihood (2 signals):**
- Owner 55-60
- One key signal (health, family, market)

**Low succession likelihood (1 signal):**
- Single demographic signal without supporting evidence

## Questions to Validate

When signals are ambiguous, these questions (if answerable) provide clarity:

1. Has the owner discussed retirement publicly?
2. Are family members active in the business? In what roles?
3. Has the company engaged transaction advisors before?
4. Are there known buyer approaches in the past?
5. What's the owner's lifestyle/interests outside the business?

## Atlantic Canada Specifics

- Owners often work longer than national averages
- Family succession expectations are strong (guilt about selling)
- "Selling out" can carry negative connotations locally
- Relationships with employees/community factor into exit decisions
- Timing may align with key community/family events
