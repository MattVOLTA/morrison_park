Here is the executive summary of my idea to create ideas:

Informed Ideation. We are building a proprietary Informed Ideation OS that fuses our CRM with public data to propose specific, evidence‑backed ideas—M&A pairings, capital solutions, partnerships, and exec placements—each with rationale, stakeholders, risks, and a next best action. This turns brand & reputation into warm origination, and keeps bankers focused on the high‑judgment last mile.
 

How do we do this?  Step 1 is to use our proprietary database and the public domain and every single market touchpoint (emails, meeting transcripts, event presentations etc.) to build a CRM that can be used to build “market maps” with nodes being selectable inputs based on some combination of geography, industry, people, companies, investors, management, BOD, customers, suppliers etc.  Step 2 is to build the magic.  The magic is an algorithm that can take a market map and predict needs or objectives of any of the nodes and suggest informed ideas or “idea cards” including hypothesis, rationale, evidence, stakeholders, risks, action plan and best next step.
 

Now that would be a world conquering, game changing technology with broader application that may be a company/service offering in itself.
