This is awesome.  Below I am probably providing you way more information than you want but I can’t help myself.  I find this stuff fascinating and potentially very productive.

 

 

I am okay with the report format given it is an easy to read summary of information that approximates what we would typically gather on a name that we wanted to research.

 

On ideation I see that it is focussed on M&A (sell side) and using “succession signals” and “transaction triggers” to assess the likelihood of a company sale.  This is great start and I’ll think about refining further.  There are a couple of other client/company profiles that are attractive to me that could be used for the idea engine.

 

Buy side: The first would be a company that is growing through acquisitions.  If I can show a company of this type good targets and/or provide warm introductions to companies or play an intermediary communication role with the company to begin a discussion (which has benefits for the company), then that company might hire me for a “buy side” mandate.  If that company has a stated objective or strategy to grow their business in a specific geography like the US or they want to expand their operations horizontally or vertically through acquisition then I could be thoughtful about what targets I show them.  I could also use my global network to identify targets in sectors or geographies that may not be obvious.  We belong to a global network of firms that are like ours.  We are one of two Canadian firms in the network.  There are ~50 firms in ~50 countries around the world and we can leverage that network for ideas, introductions, local boots on the ground help on communication/execution or anything.  Buy side mandates can evolve into capital raise mandates if the company requires external capital to fund acquisitions.  Signals and triggers for this opportunity would be announcements by the company about making closing acquisitions obviously but reference to the strategy could also be in company presentations, speaking engagements etc.  Often, if there is a change in senior mgmt. like a new CEO or CFO or hiring a VP of BD it may come with a press release discussing a new vision or strategy that the company is pursuing.  Good indicators.
 

Growth: The second client company type would be a company that is also in growth mode but doing it organically.  These are typically capital raise mandates.  So, for example Sustane Technologies has proven their technology at a certain scale and now wants to expand their current facility and continue development of expansion sites using their proven proprietary model.  They need to raise capital externally to do this.  I may be helping on this.  When we get involved in mandates of this type it isn’t just raising capital.  It is more like establishing a partnership because the investors we go to are not “retail” such as individuals who just want to make investments they like.  Our investors are typically “institutional/financial” such as PE funds or “strategic” like companies that are in the same industry and may want a position in a related company.  So the negotiation is much more involved and our job is to find the best possible partner, all things considered.  Not just getting the best price.  Companies in growth mode can need all kinds of help and this is the pitch I like to make to potential clients.  We can help on capital but also capital strategy/efficiency, access to people or companies or markets, filling C or board seats many things.  Signals or triggers for a companies like this could be any indicator of growth…winning new projects, customers, entering markets, hiring somebody for growth, signing a new contract, a new CEO making a speech about a new vision, a company getting added to lists like “fastest growing” or “best this or that” etc.  Here is link to press release from Sustane announcing a new offtake contract with BASF…a big moment and a strong indicator of progress and a bright future: https://sustanetech.com/sustane-technologies-announces-offtake-agreement-with-globalleader-basf-to-advance-circular-plastics-economy/.
 

Here are some specific comments on outputs for each company:

 

IMG:  This is meaningfully value added.  It feels like AI has created something that would take an analyst potentially hours to create on their own.  AI has the ability to dig up relevant facts that could easily slip through our clunky human web searches and screens. 
Under overview it would be good to know things like major customers, major geographies for operations and sales, and, for a manufacturing company, in addition to number of SKUs we could add high level type and category of products being made like “custom steel enclosures for technology and aerospace industries”.  And companies often promote headline numbers such as 1500 customers around the world or 1500 metric tons of X produced annually largest supplier of X products to the Y industry. 
I see that some of the information has source links which is great.  Ideally there are source links for all details where possible.  For example on the people could have links to their website bio and LinkedIn. 
Under signals it says “no obvious successor”.  Does it say this because there isn’t a family member of the owner involved in the business?  Has AI searched for any commentary on succession in the public domain?  With an owner that is 70 I would be surprised if a plan was not in place but it wouldn’t be unusual for that to be kept confidential until something happens. 
The recent activity section is key.  By reading through a company’s disclosures/announcements you can get a feel for what a company is doing.  I’d like to see a complete record of these things or a button to drill down on more if desired (to keep presentation page tight).  No limitations on what activity it is…could be anything.  Everything contributes to understanding the company.
Potential acquirors, comparable transactions and Why Now sections are awesome.  This is a core activity where develop our understanding and opinions of the market and the rationale for a transaction.  This often takes a lot of work.  These lists are great starts.  Something comprehensive that even approaches the level of work we would do would be amazing.
MPA Fit Scores make me think it needs refining but a good metric worth some effort.
Stevens Group and CBCL both companies I’ve heard but not familiar with…but I should be.  So your search has already produced two quality names deserving more attention.
Acadian: Great profile with information I was not aware of.  Hired professional CEO which is a real signal.  I would dig into this for any additional information.
MPA Fit Score Transaction at 5/5 doesn’t make sense.  My read is that there likely is not a transaction here given succession/transition seems to be handled.  Only potential transactions is capital or buy side I’m guessing.  But capital unlikely since I’m guessing they have free cash flow and debt capacity to use first.  Buy side possible but very niche market and guessing they already know all the players.  That said, I’m keen to talk to JP just to hear from him (or maybe CEO) what the company’s strategies and objectives are.  Ultimately this is what I want to know from every name and then I just think about how I might be able to help.
“Market dynamics” are great, more is always better.
“Why this matters” also great and #2 Exclusive marine rights makes me think that there is a section we should have called something like “Competitive Advantages” and/or “Value Drivers” and/or “Sustainable Moats” and/or “Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats”…or maybe all three.
Potential acquirors always worth having on there but would bet good money this company is not a seller.  All signals point towards executing on a vision.  But, absolutely could be wrong.  Never really know.
Curious to know how it came up with 100-200M valuation.  That is a huge range!
Protocase: 
Fit Score: Should rank higher than Acadian on transaction.  Protocase is more likely for us to a deal with given the aggressive growth objectives of the founder.  Could be capital or targets.  Doug and Steve are getting up in age but ambitious and still going hard.
Not sure where revenue number is from but Doug told me they are at or in excess of 100M and the range is huge.  Begs the question of source and accuracy.
Just like on potential acquirors it is worth having “Succession Signals” even though I’d bet good money they are not sellers.  It is all good information.
I know Doug will consider acquisitions so a natural would be to run a target search and see what comes up.  At minimum it would be a reason to engage with him and lean more.
Since I know that Doug is also founder/owner of 45 Drives and Advanced Glazings I’d be really interested in know how these company’s are connected…not necessarily technically…I mean why did Doug, a gifted engineer, create custom steel enclosure company, tech hardware company and tech filled glass company.  Is there a common thread somehow?  Is there an overall strategy?  Obviously this is best answered by Doug himself but here is where a market map can surface patterns humans might otherwise miss.
The Cap Table is always of great interest to us.  Unlikely to ever get one from public domain but there could be media or something making reference to investors making investments in a certain company.  When we want to reach out to a company we always try to find a connection…at the company or the board or investors or mutual friends/contacts, anything to work with.  Finding these connections have great value.  JP Deveau ignored me for over a year before I discovered he skis with my partner then he responded.
Emmerson:
Fit Score: okay so very similar to Acadian in that it is G3 and on surface it appears that succession/transition is handled.  But I suspect something is going to happen here based only on a brief discussion with the owner.  Hard for AI to know that.
I notice that each report might contain different sections.  This one has section on Client Base, which is awesome, but not key differentiators or comparable transactions for example.  Its all good stuff.
Insights Podcast with Don and David is an incredible source of information for Atlantic Region companies.  It has been meaningful in identifying potential clients and opportunities.  Can AI actually use publicly available audio as a source?  Could be for building out profiles of companies or building CRM of people with lots of good information about the individual.  It’s a gold mine.  Even just running AI on these podcasts alone could surface patterns, themes etc. between companies, people, government or whoever that could have great value.
AllNovaScotia another great resource but it is paywalled and very protected from copying/forwarding information.  I don’t want to break any rules but of course this big archive of content would be an awesome source of information.
Sustainable Blue:  So this one is interesting.  Yes they did have a catastrophic failure in 2023 which sent the company into bankruptcy in 2024.  But they came out of it with new investors which sets the company up for success.  I do not penalize the company for the massive failure.  In fact, much like with startups, failures are great learning moments.  If what the CEO was saying and showing me is all true then this company’s future is probably bright and they will almost certainly need help to raise capital to expand.  However, similar to Emmerson, it hard to know this from just public information so understandable that AI concludes that this company is surrounded by yellow tape and red flashing lights.
What I would love see if possible is a deeper dive on the tech and the claims made by the company.  A 100% closed recirculating aquaculture system is unique and game changing, according to the company.  Is there a way to test or diligence this claim?  Certainly conducting diligence on claims made by companies is part of our job.  I am sure AI can streamline this too.  But, on things like proprietary technologies it would be great to run AI on science, research, white papers, competing technologies etc. to test claims.  In this case the big difference is chemical filtration as opposed to mechanical filtration.  I’m sure AI could come up with some good stuff on this.
Higher level strategy referred to in previous email is the connection among successful business people investing in local businesses with promise.  These guys make meaningful investments in companies and then sit on the board, advise, and I am sure have influence on major decisions…like hiring an investment banker.  Probably not possible but a market map showing companies with shared investors would have tons of value.  Sustane Tech, Oberland and Sustainable Blue is one example.  I’m sure there are others.
 

We are focussed on ideation which is great and these company profiles are great.  Part of the objective is to build a comprehensive CRM database of companies/people/investors that our ideation engine can work with to predict objectives/outcomes and/or generate ideas.  I am wondering about a detailed prompt to AI to use the public domain to populate profiles of companies/people/investors for a specific category.  For example, Copol International is a company I know in Syndney NS.  They manufacture “cast molded polypropylene films” for food packaging and other uses.  The prompt could be to create detailed profiles of companies and investment firms who are involved in or have interest in cast molded polypropelene film manufacturing and add profiles of the most relevant people…CEOs at the companies and the senior partner at the PE firm.  Often, the bios of partners at PE firms will include the sectors they are focussed on, deals they worked on and boards they sit on.  People profiles can draw from website bio, LinkedIn and other sources.  Just having these profiles to read through is a huge value add that could allow me to do my own ideation.  Next level is for AI to create a market map and then use it for ideation, perhaps with guidance/prompts from us.

 

That is all I’ve got for now!  Let me know what you’d like to do next.
