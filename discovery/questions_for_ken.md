# Questions for Ken Skinner

## Purpose
Gather data and context to validate assumptions for the Informed Ideation OS proof-of-concept.

---

## Value Risk: Will this help Ken close more deals?

### Baseline Metrics (Current State)

1. **Meeting volume**: How many companies do you typically meet with per Halifax trip?

2. **Meeting quality**: Of those meetings, what % would you rate as "high quality" (real opportunity, right fit)?

3. **Proposal rate**: What % of meetings advance to a formal proposal or pitch?

4. **Win rate**: What % of proposals convert to signed engagements?

5. **Time to close**: From first meeting to signed engagement, what's the typical timeline?

6. **Deal source attribution**: Of your current active discussions (~12 mentioned), how did each originate?
   - Cold outreach by you/analysts?
   - Referral from inner circle?
   - Inbound inquiry?
   - Conference/event connection?

### Quality Indicators

7. **What makes a "rainbow" (wasted effort)?** Can you describe 2-3 examples of opportunities that consumed time but went nowhere? What signals, in hindsight, should have deprioritized them?

8. **What makes a "slam dunk"?** Describe 2-3 of your best Atlantic Canada opportunities. What was different about how you found them or what you knew going in?

## Viability Risk: Does this work for MPA's business?

9. **Deal economics**: What's a typical engagement fee range for Atlantic Canada mid-market deals? (Helps us understand ROI threshold for tooling investment)

10. **Capacity constraint**: If lead quality doubled overnight, could you handle the volume? Or is the constraint also Ken's time for high-value meetings?

11. **Analyst capacity**: How much analyst time currently goes to Atlantic Canada research per week?

---

## Fit Risk: Is MPA right for these leads?

12. **Sweet spot definition**: What company profile is MPA best positioned to serve in Atlantic Canada?
    - Revenue range?
    - Deal size range?
    - Industry preferences?
    - Ownership structure (founder-owned, PE-backed, family)?

13. **Disqualifiers**: What types of companies should the system filter OUT? (Too small, wrong industry, already has advisor, etc.)

14. **Competitive positioning**: When you lose a deal to another advisor (Grant Thornton, RBC, etc.), what's usually the reason?

---

## Usability Risk: Will Ken actually use this?

15. **Workflow integration**: Walk me through your typical Monday morning before a Halifax trip. Where would new information be most valuable?

16. **Information format**: When you get research from analysts, what format works best? (Briefing doc, email summary, database record, something else?)

17. **Alert fatigue threshold**: How many "leads to review" per week would be useful vs. overwhelming?

---

## Feasibility Risk: Can we build it?

18. **Data access**: What systems/data does MPA currently have?
    - CRM platform?
    - Deal tracking database?
    - Meeting notes repository?
    - Email/calendar integration?

19. **Proprietary intelligence**: What's in your Atlantic Canada database that wouldn't be in public sources? (This is the "moat" for the knowledge graph)

20. **Compliance/confidentiality**: Are there restrictions on how client/prospect data can be used or stored?

---

## Engagement Model: Risk-Reward Sharing

21. **Value-sharing structure**: If Matt builds this at no cost to MPA, would you be open to a success-based arrangement where Matt participates in upside? For example:
    - Referral fee (% of engagement fees on system-sourced deals)?
    - Flat success bonus per closed deal?
    - Something else?

22. **Attribution clarity**: How would we determine if a deal was "sourced by the system" vs. would have happened anyway? (Important for any success-based model)

23. **Cap or sunset**: What structure would feel fair? (e.g., capped at $X total, limited to Y deals, or sunsets after Z months)

24. **Legal/compliance**: Would MPA's partnership structure allow this kind of arrangement? Any regulatory considerations?

---

## Competitive Positioning (From Market Research)

25. **Windsor Drake awareness**: Are you aware of Windsor Drake (Halifax-based M&A boutique)? Have you competed against them for mandates?

26. **Competitive wins/losses**: When you've won Atlantic Canada mandates, what was the deciding factor? When you've lost, why?

27. **Regional presence plans**: Is there any consideration of opening a Halifax presence (office, partner, or affiliated advisor)?

28. **Track record visibility**: Are there Atlantic Canada deals MPA has completed that aren't publicly disclosed? Would any clients provide references or case studies?

29. **Sector gaps**: The research shows seafood/aquaculture and renewable energy are underserved. Is MPA interested in these verticals, or prefer to focus on mining/energy/industrial?

30. **Succession specialization**: Would MPA position itself for family business succession advisory (integrating with estate/tax planners), or stay focused on pure transaction execution?
