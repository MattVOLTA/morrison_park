  Atlantic Canada Presence

  MPA has a long-standing commitment to Atlantic Canada:

  - Founding sponsor of Dalhousie University's entrepreneurship programs (~10 years)
  - Sponsor of Dal Innovates, Lab2Market, Ready2Launch Pitch Day, and Demo Day
  - Supports student ventures from Dalhousie, Acadia, Memorial, Saint Mary's, and UPEI
  - CEO Brent Walker holds a BSc from Dalhousie University
  - Ken Skinner leads the Atlantic Canada origination effort (per conversation: ~1.5 years focused push)

  The historical clients Ken mentioned (Emera, Fortis, Crombie, Killam) align with their Scotia Capital heritage when they served large-cap Atlantic Canadian companies before pivoting to mid-market focus.

  Competitive Positioning

  Differentiators:
  1. Independence - Partner-owned, no conflicts from lending/trading arms
  2. Senior-led execution - Partners stay involved throughout deals
  3. Special Committee expertise - Willing to provide opinions where large banks won't due to litigation risk
  4. Mid-market focus - Multi-billion deal experience applied to companies valued in tens of millions
  5. Long-term relationships - Emphasis on trust-building over transactional work

  Challenge (per Ken): Growth constrained by human bandwidth - "nothing happens unless I do it"
