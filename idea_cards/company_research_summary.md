**Industry:** Land-Based RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture System) Salmon Farming
**Founded:** 2010s development, commercial operations 2023
**Revenue:** ~$5M (pre-crisis estimate)
**Employees:** 12

### Ownership (Complex & In Flux)
- **CEO:** Kirk Havercroft
- **President:** Dr. Jeremy Lee (Sustainable Fish Farming)
- **Previous Majority Owner:** Bayt Al Qoot UK Ltd (Saudi investors) via complex structure
- **Current Status:** Under receivership since April 2024
- **New Owners (Sept 2024):** Thane Stevens & Jim Lawley (minority shareholders) via 4595756 Nova Scotia Ltd - acquired through $30M CAD stalking horse bid (unopposed)

### Critical Context: DISTRESSED ASSET
- **Nov 2023:** 96,000 salmon died ($5M loss) due to biological filter structural collapse
- **April 2024:** Entered receivership (Deloitte appointed as receiver)
- **July 2024:** Sales process deadline
- **Sept 2024:** Stevens/Lawley became successful bidders (no other qualified offers)
- **Nov 2025:** Still under receivership, ramping up production

### Technology & Capacity
- World's first closed-loop, land-based saltwater fishery
- 100% water reuse, zero wastewater emissions
- 1,000 tonnes annual capacity
- 259 Red Bank Rd facility, Centre Burlington
- Proprietary RAS technology (TCAS IP)

### Notable Investors (Historical)
- Yvon Chouinard (Patagonia founder)
- Saudi Arabian investment club ($28M in 2020)

### Market Context
- Land-based salmon market: $4.28B (2024) → $6.18B (2031), 5.20% CAGR
- RAS investment to surpass $1B annually in 2025
- Salmonid projects worth $1.2B coming online in 2025
- **Comparable Transaction:** AquaBounty sold Indiana RAS facility to Superior Fresh for $9.5M (July 2024) - 1,200 tonne capacity
- **Other Activity:** Danish Salmon acquired by Marubeni/Nissui, Pure Salmon raising capital

### Current Situation Assessment
**RESTRUCTURING OPPORTUNITY / HIGH RISK**

**Challenges:**
- Currently under receivership
- Major fish loss event (Nov 2023)
- Required $12M post-crisis, only raised ~$4M before receivership
- Operational viability still being proven
- Technology risk inherent in land-based RAS
- Competitive RAS sector with multiple failures

**Potential Opportunities:**
- Recapitalized under new ownership (Stevens/Lawley)
- Facility and technology intact
- Zero-discharge system differentiation
- Growing market for sustainable salmon
- Atlantic Canada location (Canadian/US market access)

### Potential Acquirers (Post-Restructuring)
- Established aquaculture companies seeking RAS expertise
- Food companies pursuing vertical integration
- Asian seafood conglomerates (Marubeni, Nissui precedent)
- Impact investors focused on sustainable aquaculture
- **Current owners may seek operating partner or strategic investor**

### Est. Current Value
Distressed asset - $30M stalking horse bid (Sept 2024) represents current market value
- Note: AquaBounty's 1,200-tonne facility sold for $9.5M suggests per-tonne capacity valuation
- Sustainable Blue's 1,000-tonne capacity with zero-discharge tech likely supports higher valuation if operational viability demonstrated

### MPA Perspective
**NOT RECOMMENDED as traditional M&A target at this time**
- Company in active restructuring under receivership
- Operational viability unproven post-crisis
- New ownership still demonstrating turnaround capability
- High technical and execution risk

**Possible Future Consideration:**
- Monitor for 12-24 months
- If operations stabilize and profitability demonstrated
- Could become attractive distressed M&A opportunity or partnership
- Technology may have value independent of current operations
