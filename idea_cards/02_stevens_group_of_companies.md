## Succession Signals

| Signal | Present? | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Owner age 55+ | **YES** | Third-gen leaders ~65-70, active since 1980s |
| Long tenure (15+ years) | **YES** | 40+ years for Thane and Scott |
| No obvious successor | **MIXED** | Fourth generation involved but roles unclear |
| Recent health/life event | **YES** | Marilyn Stevens (LB's wife) passed Dec 2024 |
| Slowing growth/investment | **NO** | Major LTC facility under construction |
| Key person departures | **NO** | Stable leadership team |
| Estate/wealth planning activity | **LIKELY** | Stevens Family Foundation established 2008 |

**Succession Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH

Second-generation leadership has fully transitioned (LB Stevens retired/passed, Marilyn Stevens passed December 2024). Third-generation (Thane and Scott) are in their late 60s. Fourth-generation involvement is documented but leadership roles are not formalized publicly. The 2008 establishment of Stevens Family Foundation and 2025 Hall of Fame recognition suggest deliberate legacy planning.

## Deal Readiness Indicators

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Financial health | Strong | $300M+ revenue, active capital investment |
| Market position | Dominant | Largest concrete supplier in Atlantic Canada |
| Management depth | Strong | Professional management in key divisions |
| Clean ownership | Clean | 100% family-owned, no PE |
| Industry dynamics | Consolidating | Building materials sector active for M&A |

---

## Potential Transaction Triggers

1. **Third-generation age (65-70)** - Both Thane and Scott approaching typical exit window
2. **Second-generation transition complete** - Marilyn Stevens passed December 2024, marking end of founder era
3. **Hall of Fame recognition** - Often signals "capstone" phase of career
4. **Stevens Family Foundation (2008)** - Governance structure for family wealth/legacy
5. **Fourth-generation unclear** - May prefer liquidity over operational control
6. **Scale attracts buyers** - $300M+ platform attractive to PE/strategics

---

## Deal Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Family Recapitalization / Partial Sale
**Rationale:** Third-generation may want liquidity without full exit. Structure that provides liquidity to Thane/Scott while fourth-generation remains involved in operations.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. Complex family recapitalization is core MPA capability.

**Next Action:** Determine fourth-generation career paths and interest in operational roles.

### Hypothesis 2: Platform Sale to PE
**Rationale:** $300M diversified platform with dominant regional positions in concrete, construction, healthcare is highly attractive to PE for buy-and-build strategy.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. Sell-side M&A in industrials/building products.

**Next Action:** Research PE activity in Atlantic Canada building materials sector.

### Hypothesis 3: Divisional Carve-Out
**Rationale:** 30 subsidiaries across diverse industries (concrete, construction, healthcare, storage). Family may want to exit some segments while retaining others.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. Complex transaction structuring and carve-out expertise.

**Next Action:** Identify which divisions might be logical sale candidates vs. core family holdings.

---

## Red Flags / Disqualifiers

- **Size may exceed MPA sweet spot** - $300M+ revenue may be at upper boundary
- **Active investment suggests no immediate exit** - 144-bed LTC facility under construction
- **Family succession may be working** - Fourth generation involvement could indicate internal transition
- **Lafarge relationship** - 2016 JV with Lafarge means existing institutional partner/potential bidder

---

## Information Gaps

- [ ] Specific ownership percentages among Thane, Scott, and extended family
- [ ] Fourth-generation identities, roles, and succession intentions
- [ ] Has family engaged advisors or received approaches before?
- [ ] LB Stevens estate resolution and impact on ownership structure
- [ ] Thane and Scott's actual exit timeline/intentions

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Ken's network** - Does anyone know Thane Stevens or Stevens family?
2. **NS Business Hall of Fame connection** - 2025 laureate; potential networking opportunity
3. **Research Lafarge relationship** - Could they be a buyer for remaining stake?
4. **Credit union connections** - Quality Concrete serves regional development; may have lender relationships
5. **Philanthropic overlap** - Stevens Family Foundation interests may connect to Ken's network

## MPA Fit Score

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Deal size fit | 3/5 | At upper end of MPA range ($300M+ revenue) |
| Industry fit | 5/5 | Construction/industrials is core MPA |
| Geographic fit | 5/5 | Nova Scotia HQ, Ken's region |
| Transaction type | 5/5 | Succession/recap fits MPA perfectly |
| Relationship path | ?/5 | Unknown - needs research |

**Overall:** HIGH PRIORITY - if relationship path exists and family is ready
