## Succession Signals

| Signal | Present? | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Owner age 55+ | **YES** | ~70 years old (born ~1954) |
| Long tenure (15+ years) | **YES** | 45 years as founder/CEO |
| No obvious successor | **MIXED** | Bradley Spencer positioned as COO since 2016 |
| Recent health/life event | Unknown | No public information |
| Slowing growth/investment | **NO** | Active acquirer through 2023 |
| Key person departures | **NO** | Stable leadership team |
| Estate/wealth planning activity | **LIKELY** | Order of Canada, major philanthropic gifts |

**Succession Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH

The 2009 Financial Post explicitly noted IMG "had never been through a succession" when Caissie was 57. Fifteen years later, no formal succession has been announced. However, Bradley Spencer's positioning as President/COO suggests internal preparation.

## Deal Readiness Indicators

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Financial health | Strong | 15 years Best Managed, active M&A |
| Market position | Dominant | North American leader in categories |
| Management depth | Strong | Professional C-suite beyond founder |
| Clean ownership | Clean | 100% founder-owned, no PE |
| Industry dynamics | Consolidating | Building products sector active |

---

## Potential Transaction Triggers

1. **Founder age (70)** - Natural succession window approaching. Most founders exit 65-75.
2. **Order of Canada / Legacy recognition** - Often signals "capstone" phase of career
3. **Major philanthropy** - Université de Moncton gift suggests wealth planning activity
4. **Industry consolidation** - PE actively rolling up building products/HVAC
5. **Bradley Spencer readiness** - Internal succession or management buyout possible

---

## Deal Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Succession Advisory
**Rationale:** Founder is ~70, company has never transitioned leadership. Even if not selling, likely needs succession planning advice.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. MPA advises on complex ownership transitions, family business succession.

**Next Action:** Explore whether Ken has any relationship to Caissie or NB business community.

### Hypothesis 2: Strategic Sale to PE or Strategic
**Rationale:** $137M revenue platform in fragmented building products/HVAC sector is attractive roll-up target. Founder may be ready to monetize after 45 years.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. Sell-side M&A in industrials is core MPA capability.

**Next Action:** Research PE interest in building products sector; identify likely buyers.

### Hypothesis 3: Recapitalization / Partial Sale
**Rationale:** Caissie may want liquidity without full exit. Spencer-led MBO with PE backing is possible.

**MPA Fit:** Strong. Capital raising and transaction structuring.

**Next Action:** Determine if family members beyond Normand have ownership interests.

---

## Red Flags / Disqualifiers

- **Not in Atlantic Canada core** - Richibucto, NB is Ken's region, but IMG is national/continental scale
- **May be too large** - $137M revenue may exceed typical MPA mid-market sweet spot
- **Founder may not be ready** - Still actively acquiring, may want to continue

---

## Information Gaps

- [ ] Exact ownership structure (100% Normand? Family trusts?)
- [ ] Is Bradley Spencer a designated successor or just operational?
- [ ] Family member involvement beyond Normand and Mario
- [ ] Has IMG been approached by buyers/PE before?
- [ ] Normand's actual exit timeline/intentions

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Ken's network** - Does anyone know Normand Caissie or IMG leadership?
2. **Research buyers** - Who has acquired similar building products platforms?
3. **Warm intro path** - JA New Brunswick, Wallace McCain Institute, Université de Moncton connections?
4. **Conference attendance** - Does Caissie attend ACG Atlantic or similar?

## MPA Fit Score

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Deal size fit | 4/5 | May be at upper end of MPA range |
| Industry fit | 5/5 | Industrials/manufacturing is core |
| Geographic fit | 4/5 | NB-based but national operations |
| Transaction type | 5/5 | Succession/sale fits MPA |
| Relationship path | ?/5 | Unknown - needs research |

**Overall:** HIGH PRIORITY - if relationship path exists
